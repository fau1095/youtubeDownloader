# youtubeDownloader program to download YouTube videos and converting them to an .mp3 file, have fun!

To create an executable application for your system:

>>> MacOS

1. Open Script Editor app, which can be found under the Applications folder of your main Hard Drive

2. Paste the following into the editor:

    tell application "Terminal"
	    do script with command "python /Users/YOURPATH  ytDownloader.py"
    end tell

3. Go to File -> Export

4. On "Where:" I would suggest putting the application into the Applications folder

5. On "File Format:" , choose Application instead of Script, hit save.

6. Double click your new application to run the automation

7. Enjoy!
